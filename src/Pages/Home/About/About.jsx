Having specific targets in mind can keep you on the right path and help you accomplish your goals—this is true for the written work product and the time you’ll spend writing it.

For your project, start by listing objectives. If we list our objectives before we write, we need not worry about forgetting something important. Plus sorting through our ideas first helps us see the best way to make them flow. Your list may become an outline, which will help you organize the details of your paper, presentation, study, or document. An outline anchors your main topic and supporting details so your content flows better.</h1>
